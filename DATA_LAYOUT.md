# Data Layout

Keep source ECG records, processed NPZ files, generated experiment outputs, and reference implementations separate.

This project's maintained training environment is `src/`. The original PC-SCFM workspace is preserved under `references/pc_scfm_original/` for reference only.

```

## Data Root

Default data root used by the configs when commands are run through `scripts/*.sh`:

```text
<PROJECT_ROOT>/data/ecg_baseline_wander
```

Recommended data layout:

```text
ecg_baseline_wander/
  raw/
    PTBXL/
      ptbxl_database.csv
      records100/
      records500/
    NSTDB/
    MITBIH/
    Chapman/
    CPSC/
    other/

  processed/
    train.npz
    val.npz
    test.npz
    mit_bih.npz
    chapman.npz
    cpsc.npz
    qtdb.npz

  controlled_tests/
    exp2_strength/
    exp3_frequency/
```

The folders above are created under:

```text
<PROJECT_ROOT>/data/ecg_baseline_wander
```

Use `raw/` for downloaded or extracted source datasets. Do not train directly from `raw/`.

Use `processed/` for model-ready NPZ files. The dataset loader reads files from `processed/` by split name.

Use `controlled_tests/` for generated robustness test sets, such as baseline strength and frequency sweeps.

## Required Processed Files

Minimum files for training and in-domain testing:

```text
processed/train.npz
processed/val.npz
processed/test.npz
```

Recommended files:

```text
processed/train.npz
processed/val.npz
processed/test.npz
processed/mit_bih.npz
processed/chapman.npz
processed/cpsc.npz
processed/qtdb.npz
```

Training uses `val.npz` as the PTB-XL fold 9 validation split for checkpoint selection and early stopping. PTB-XL train/val/test NPZ files must include fold metadata so the loader can enforce the official fold split.

## NPZ Schema

Each processed NPZ must contain either:

```text
noisy_ecg
clean_reference
```

or the alternate names:

```text
input
target
```

Expected array shape:

```text
[N, T]
[N, 1, T]
```

Do not store 12-lead arrays as `[N, 12, T]` for the current models. This experiment environment is configured for single-lead ECG baseline-wander removal.

For PTB-XL official fold validation, processed NPZ files may include one of these metadata keys:

```text
ptbxl_fold
strat_fold
fold
```

Expected folds:

```text
train.npz: folds 1-8
val.npz: fold 9
test.npz: fold 10
```

## Config Data Path

Preprocessing should use the shared config:

```text
src/configs/ecg_baseline_wander_preprocess_common.yaml
```

Model-specific configs should be used for training only, so their paper-faithful optimizer/loss/scheduler settings do not accidentally change the shared processed NPZ files.

All maintained configs use this top-level setting:

```yaml
data_dir: "../data/ecg_baseline_wander"
root_dir: "../runs/ecg_baseline_wander"
```

Dataset loading resolves processed files as:

```text
${data_dir}/processed/train.npz
${data_dir}/processed/val.npz
${data_dir}/processed/test.npz
```

To use a different data location, update `data_dir` in the config, or pass an OmegaConf override:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>/src

python3 train_supervised.py \
  --config configs/ecg_baseline_wander_pc_scfm.yaml \
  data_dir=/path/to/ecg_baseline_wander
```

## Output Layout

Default output root:

```text
<PROJECT_ROOT>/runs/ecg_baseline_wander
```

Generated outputs:

```text
runs/ecg_baseline_wander/
  checkpoint/
    <exp_name>/<model_name>/
      best_pcc_model.pt
      best_model.pt
      model_last.pt
      training_state.pt

  results/
    <exp_name>/<model_name>/
      best_pcc/
        metrics_ptbxl_fold10_test.yaml
        metrics_mit_bih.yaml
        metrics_chapman.yaml
        metrics_cpsc.yaml
        metrics_qtdb.yaml
        complexity_summary.yaml
      best_loss/

  log/
    <exp_name>/<model_name>/log.log

  exp7_ablation/
    ablation_plan.csv
    configs/
    summary.csv
```

Generated outputs should not be committed.

## Common Commands

Check whether required data exists:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>
bash scripts/check_project.sh
```

Train PC-SCFM:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>
bash scripts/train_model.sh pc_scfm
```

Train comparison models:

```bash
bash scripts/train_model.sh mecg_e
bash scripts/train_model.sh mambattention
```

Generate PC-SCFM ablation configs:

```bash
bash scripts/run_pcscfm_ablation.sh --summarize-only
```

Train all PC-SCFM ablations:

```bash
bash scripts/run_pcscfm_ablation.sh --run-train
```

## Notes

`references/pc_scfm_original/` may still contain older `pkl`-based scripts and folders such as `data/`, `raw_data/`, and `external_data/`. Those belong to the original reference workspace.

For the current `rl_exp/src` experiments, use the NPZ layout described above.
